# RailOptima
 RailOptima is an intelligent decision-support system for railway traffic management. It optimizes train precedence, crossings, and scheduling while dynamically re-optimizing under disruptions. Built on the FRPS stack (FastAPI, React, Python, SQL), it boosts efficiency, punctuality, and controller decision-making.
